# Week 1 – Smart Waste Management System using AI ♻️

## 🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that can automatically classify waste images into **Organic**, **Recyclable**, or **Hazardous** categories.  
This promotes sustainable waste management by reducing manual sorting and improving recycling efficiency.

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand the problem of waste segregation.
- Explore and prepare the dataset from Kaggle.
- Plan CNN architecture and implementation steps.

## 📅 Tasks Completed in Week 1
- Selected project: *Smart Waste Management System using AI*  
- Identified dataset: [Waste Classification Dataset (TechSash)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data)  
- Created project repository on GitHub.  
- Drafted project goal, objective, and sustainability outcome.

## 🌱 Expected Outcome
A CNN model that classifies waste images into 3 categories:
1. Organic  
2. Recyclable  
3. Hazardous  

This system aims to help communities and municipalities adopt smarter, cleaner waste disposal methods.

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Google Colab
